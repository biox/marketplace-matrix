build scripts for our 1-click app!

## Create your new server

Keep in mind when selecting a monthly plan that the more resources you can
provide, the better the chat quality will be. 2GB+ RAM is highly recommended.

## Dependencies

- A new domain you'd like to use exclusively for Matrix (it is recommended
  and also very cute to buy a .town, .space, or similar domain for this purpose)
- openssh (or putty)
- 5 minutes

## Finishing Setup

1. Login to your droplet via `ssh root@your_droplet_public_ipv4`
2. Run ./finish-setup
3. When directed, set up your DNS records
4. Read /root/README.txt
5. ???
6. Profit!

## Building the image

export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=your_do_token
